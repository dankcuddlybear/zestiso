# Require confirmation when uninstalling these packages, so they can't be accidentally uninstalled.
# You cannot uninstall these in a graphical package manager, you have to use the pacman command-line interface.
# I have included A: The minimum required packages needed to boot, configure and use Arch Linux (e.g. bootloader, microcode and firmware, networkmanager, pacman, sudo)
# B: Extra packages that provide useful functionality (e.g. extra software repositories, sound server, meta-packages)
# C: A list of Linux kernels and headers for all kernels in the official and third-party repositories (AUR-only kernels and headers not included)

# By default, pacman accepts packages signed by keys that its local keyring
# trusts (see pacman-key and its man page), as well as unsigned packages.
SigLevel    = Required DatabaseOptional
LocalFileSigLevel = Optional
#RemoteFileSigLevel = Required

# NOTE: You must run `pacman-key --init` before first using pacman; the local
# keyring can then be populated with the keys of all official Arch Linux
# packagers with `pacman-key --populate archlinux`.

#
# REPOSITORIES
#   - can be defined here or included from another file
#   - pacman will search repositories in the order defined here
#   - local/custom mirrors can be added here or in separate files
#   - repositories listed first will take precedence when packages
#     have identical names, regardless of version number
#   - URLs will have $repo replaced by the name of the current repo
#   - URLs will have $arch replaced by the name of the architecture
#
# Repository entries are of the format:
#       [repo-name]
#       Server = ServerName
#       Include = IncludePath
#
# The header [repo-name] is crucial - it must be present and
# uncommented to enable the repo.
