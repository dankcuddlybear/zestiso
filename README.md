ZestISO is a set of scripts and presets to easily customise, build and install Arch Linux.

The official Arch Linux releases are built with archiso, so this is what I am using for ZestISO. Archiso reads a custom profile (preset) and builds the ISO (the Arch Linux boot/install media).
You can specify what software/services you want to include, system configuration and first-boot setup, ISO info/build options and more.
ArchISO has a few limitations however:
 - The only supported boot loaders are Syslinux for legacy BIOS systems, and GRUB or Systemd-boot for modern UEFI systems.
 - ArchISO only supports booting an initramfs created with mkinitcpio using udev (busybox) init system. Systemd init and Dracut/Booster are not supported.
